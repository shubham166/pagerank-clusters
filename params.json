{"name":"Efficient Page Rank Computation  on Clusters","tagline":"- using mpi and openMp APIs","body":"Hello\r\n\r\nThis is my small academic project on Efficient Page Rank computation on clusters. It uses message passing interface for parallel computation by scattering chunks of pages to individual nodes and gathering the result at master node. Similarly, openMp APIs are used to utilize all the cores of a node efficiently and give result taking minimum time.\r\n\r\nThanks","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
